# Credit-Risk-Assessment-Spreadsheet-Decision-Model
This spreadsheet project simulates a real-world credit risk assessment system used by banks to evaluate loan applications based on borrower profiles. 

The model calculates the probability of loan default using key factors such as income level, credit history length, and past default records, and then applies expected value logic to estimate risk-adjusted profit. 

Expected profit is derived from the loan amount and interest rate, which is then adjusted by the probability of default to reflect realistic risk exposure. 

Based on this adjusted value, the spreadsheet automatically classifies each application as Approve, Review, or Reject, ensuring decisions are made only when the expected return outweighs the risk. 

The project also analyzes overall default rates and correlations between income, credit history, and loan outcomes, helping visualize portfolio-level risk and demonstrating how financial institutions automate rational, data-driven lending decisions entirely within spreadsheets.
